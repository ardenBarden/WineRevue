# WineRevue

##Problem
Wine Revue, a small local cafe and wine bar in Lake Jackson, Texas, wants to expand their services to B2B catering and delivery. They don't want to pile too much on their plate, though (lol!)-- they want to start by sending an advertisement to all local businesses within a 5-mile radius of their venue. 

##Approach
This program uses the Maven Wizard in Eclipse to build a simple template and implement a dependency on Jsoup, a Java web-scraper package.
This [link] (https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseMaven/article.html) was helpful to set Maven up.
